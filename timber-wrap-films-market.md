<p><strong>The Timber Wrap Films Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hardwoods</li><li>Softwoods</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Timber wrap films are protective coverings used to safeguard hardwoods and softwoods during storage, transportation, and handling. For hardwoods, which are dense and durable, these films prevent moisture absorption, scratches, and UV damage, ensuring the wood retains its quality and appearance. Softwoods, being lighter and more porous, benefit from timber wraps by reducing exposure to environmental factors like humidity and temperature changes, which can cause warping or decay. Both applications enhance the longevity and market value of the timber.</p></p>
